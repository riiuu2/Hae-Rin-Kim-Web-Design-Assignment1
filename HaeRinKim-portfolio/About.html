    <H2>About the world of Coffee</H2>
    <p>What is Coffee? Coffee is a brewed beverage made from the seeds of the Coffea plant, commonly referred to as coffee beans. These seeds are roasted and then ground to produce the aromatic drink enjoyed by millions around the world. Coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant that provides a temporary energy boost and enhances alertness.</p>

    <p><h3>Types of Coffee Beans.</h3></p> 
    <p><i>There are two main species of coffee beans:</i></p>

       <p>Arabica (Coffea arabica): Known for its smooth, slightly acidic flavor and a wider range of aromatic profiles, Arabica beans are typically regarded as higher quality.</p>
      
       <p>Robusta (Coffea canephora): Has a stronger, bolder flavor with more bitterness and is higher in caffeine content. It's commonly used in espresso blends.</p>

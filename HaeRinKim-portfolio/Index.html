    <p>Coffee can have distinctive flavor profiles depending on where it's grown. Beans from Latin America (e.g., Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil) may be fruity, floral, and acidic, while beans from Indonesia (e.g., Sumatra) are often earthy, spicy, and chocolatey.</p>

    <p>Processing Methods After harvest, coffee beans go through several stages before reaching your cup, with each stage influencing the final flavor:</p>

    <p>Washed (Wet) Processing: Beans are washed to remove the fruit pulp before being dried, leading to a cleaner, brighter taste with pronounced acidity.</p>
    
   <p>Natural (Dry) Processing: The coffee cherries are left to dry with the fruit still intact, leading to sweeter, fruitier flavors but often more earthy notes as well.</p> 
    
    <p>Honey Processing: A hybrid method where some of the cherryâ€™s pulp remains attached to the bean during drying, often resulting in a balance between clean acidity and sweetness.</p>

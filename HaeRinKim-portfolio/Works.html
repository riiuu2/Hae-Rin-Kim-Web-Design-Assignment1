        <p>15th-16th Century: Coffee became a popular beverage in Yemen, where it was cultivated and traded. The Arabian Peninsula is where coffee first entered the broader world, and it became integral to Islamic culture, especially in religious and social gatherings.</p>
       
        <p> Ottoman Empire: The first coffeehouse, known as a qahveh khaneh, was established in Istanbul around 1555, and coffee quickly spread through the Ottoman Empire and into Europe.</p>
